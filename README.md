## ML Basics

This repository provides a fundamental systematic approach to transition to machine learning and neural networks.
The purpose of the repository is to provide the background understanding and the basic intuition behind the operation of most ML algorithms 
Most of the code exercises here were adapted from the MIT foundational ML course.
